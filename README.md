- 👋 Hi, I’m @essieanawalt
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript and C# with a touch of Python
  - 🪴 I'm also strengthening my existing knowledge around SQL and HTML (with CSS and C trailing along)
- 👀 I’m interested in anything in the realm of puzzles and/or creative problem solving
- 🤞🏻 I'm working to further my transition into development
- 💡 Do you have insight into front-end? back-end? software testing? product? I'd love to hear it!
